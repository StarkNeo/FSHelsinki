1.- This folder contains a copy of the frontend application made on part2 (phonebook) renamed as phonebookfrontend, over this copy I made all the changes needed to test the fullapplication and create a "dist" file to add in the phonebookbackend.

2.- To deploy the backend and then the full application I had to create a new repository called "phonebookbackend" I pushed all the files located in FSHelsinki/Part3/phonebookbackend to this new repository.

3.- This is the application address on Render https://phonebookbackend-e20o.onrender.com/

4.- Commits for exercises 3.1 to 3.9 are found on https://github.com/StarkNeo/FSHelsinki/Part3/phonebookbackend
